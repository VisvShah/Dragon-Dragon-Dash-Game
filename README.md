 Dragon Dragon Dash Mobile Game

This is a game I developed to achive my goal of publishing an app on the app store. This casual mobile game includes: a variety of levels with altering difficulty, 7 different enemy types, 4 impactful upgrade systems, 4 unique power-ups, and fun controls. This was a fun project to make and it is made up of over 1500 lines of code. I completed it with image and audio assetts and it is now as functional as any other popular game on the app store.

Here is the description on the app store:
